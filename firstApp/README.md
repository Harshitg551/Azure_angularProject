# Image Recognition and Translation

This project combines the power of various Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services to provide a range of features:

## Image Recognition

This part helps to extract features and details that might go unnoticed by many people. We leverage the **Computer Vision** component of **Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services**. It accepts an image URL as input and, after submission, analyzes it to provide information such as name, background color, dominant colors, objects categories, image description, and summary. Additionally, it can be used to generate a title for the image, incorporating these features into the project.

## Translation

This part takes English text as input and provides the corresponding Hindi translation. We utilize the **Translator component** of **Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services**. This feature is especially helpful for those who need an exact Hindi translation of English statements.

## Bing Search v7

We've also integrated the **Bing Search v7** service using Azure, which enhances search capabilities and brings more comprehensive results to our project.

## Azure Services Used

1. Azure Cognitive Services
2. Azure Image Recognition
3. Azure Language Translation
4. Azure Static Web App
5. Bing Search v7

These Azure services are central to the functionality and capabilities of our project. They empower us to provide advanced features like image recognition, translation, and comprehensive web search.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
